 Phase 1: Core Backend Setup & First Launch

   1. Project Initialization: Set up the Electron + React project structure.
   2. Dependencies: Install lancedb for the database and @xenova/transformers for embeddings.
   3. First Launch Experience:
       * On the first run, prompt the user to select a local folder for storage.
       * Initialize the LanceDB database in that folder.
       * Save the chosen path in a configuration file.
   4. README Update: Add a "First Launch" section.

  Phase 2: Adding and Storing Items

   1. Add Item UI: Create a form to input a new item's payload and description.
   2. Embedding: Integrate the Xenova WASM model to generate embeddings from the payload and description.
   3. Database Insertion: On save, insert the new item, its metadata, and the generated embedding into LanceDB.
   4. README Update: Add a feature section describing how to add new items.

  Phase 3: Search and Display

   1. Search UI: Implement the main search box.
   2. Hybrid Search: As the user types, perform a combined vector and keyword search on the stored items.
   3. Display Results: Render the search results in real-time, showing a preview for each item.
   4. README Update: Describe the search functionality and its capabilities.

  Phase 4: Recent Items & Final Touches

   1. Recent Items View: Display the five most recently accessed or added items on the main screen.
   2. Item Interaction:
       * Clicking a link item opens it in the browser.
       * Clicking a kusto_query item copies it to the clipboard.
       * Update the last_accessed_at timestamp upon interaction.
   3. UI Polish: Implement the final UI layout as specified in the requirements.
   4. README Update: Finalize the README with all features and usage instructions.

  Phase 5: Packaging and Distribution

   1. Build Configuration: Set up electron-builder to create installers for Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), and Linux (.AppImage).
   2. Build and Test: Generate and test the installers for each platform.
   3. README Update: Add an "Installation" section with instructions.
