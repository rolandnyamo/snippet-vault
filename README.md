### Architecture Notes

- **Node.js 22+**: Built and tested on Node.js 22 for latest language features and performance
- **Semantic Search**: Uses TensorFlow.js Universal Sentence Encoder (tensorflow/universal-sentence-encoder@3.3.0) for 512-dimensional embeddings
- **Browser-Compatible**: Uses TensorFlow.js web backend to avoid native dependencies
- **ES Modules**: Modern module system for better compatibility
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB for efficient vector storage and similarity search
- **Dual Storage**: Separate raw data and embeddings tables for backup resilience

## Getting Started

### First Launch

When you first launch Snippet Vault, it will automatically create a database in your system's user data directory. All of your data, including the search index and saved items, is stored locally on your computer for complete privacy.

### Adding Items

Click the **"+ New"** button to add items to your vault. You can store:

- **Links**: Save URLs with descriptions for later reference
- **Kusto Queries**: Store KQL queries with descriptions for reuse
- **Code Snippets**: Any text-based content you want to search semantically

When you save an item, Snippet Vault automatically generates a semantic embedding using the Universal Sentence Encoder. This enables intelligent search based on meaning, not just keyword matching.

### Browsing Your Items

- **Recent Tab**: Shows your 5 most recently accessed items
- **All Tab**: Displays all items with total count, sorted by creation date
- **Search Highlighting**: Matched terms are highlighted in yellow in both list and detail views

### Searching for Items

Type in the search box to perform intelligent hybrid search:

1. **Semantic Search**: Finds items with similar meaning using AI embeddings
2. **Keyword Search**: Matches exact text in descriptions and content
3. **Real-time Results**: Updates as you type with highlighted matches

### Managing Items

**View & Copy**: Click any item to view details with a copy button in the upper right corner

**Edit Items**: Click the "Edit" button in the detail view to modify descriptions or content

**Delete Items**: Hover over items in the list to see the delete (üóëÔ∏è) button, or use the delete button in the edit modal

### Data Management

Access advanced features through the **Settings** button (‚öôÔ∏é):

#### Export Data
- **JSON Format**: Complete structured export of all items
- **CSV Format**: Spreadsheet-compatible export for analysis
- **Automatic Download**: Files saved to your Downloads folder

#### Import Data
- **Append Mode**: Imports add to existing data without replacement
- **Format Support**: JSON and CSV file imports
- **Validation**: Ensures required fields are present before import

#### Model Information
- **Current Model**: View the embedding model in use
- **Version Tracking**: Each embedding tracks its model version
- **Test Regeneration**: Force regenerate all embeddings for testing

#### Danger Zone
- **Delete All Data**: Complete data wipe with triple confirmation
- **Backup Reminder**: Always export your data before using this option

### Model Updates & Versioning

Snippet Vault automatically handles model updates:

1. **Version Detection**: Each embedding tracks its model version
2. **Auto-Regeneration**: When opening items created with older models, embeddings are automatically updated
3. **Seamless Migration**: Raw data is preserved, only embeddings are regenerated
4. **No Data Loss**: Original content is always maintained in the backup table

## FAQ

### Where are my files stored?

Your data is stored locally in your system's user data directory:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/snippet-vault/database/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/snippet-vault/database/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/snippet-vault/database/`

You can see the exact path in Settings. Use "Show in Folder" to open the location in your file manager.

### What does Snippet Vault do exactly?

Snippet Vault is a smart storage and search tool for code snippets, queries, and links. It uses AI (TensorFlow.js Universal Sentence Encoder) to understand the meaning of your content, allowing you to find items by describing what you're looking for rather than remembering exact keywords.

For example, searching for "database connection" might find a snippet about "SQL server setup" because the AI understands they're semantically related.

### Does it share my data anywhere?

**Absolutely not.** Snippet Vault is designed with privacy as the top priority:

- ‚úÖ **100% Offline**: All processing happens on your machine
- ‚úÖ **No Network Calls**: No data is ever transmitted to external servers
- ‚úÖ **Local AI Models**: The TensorFlow.js models run entirely in your browser
- ‚úÖ **Local Database**: All storage is local LanceDB files on your computer
- ‚úÖ **No Telemetry**: No usage tracking or analytics

### How does the AI search work?

Snippet Vault uses Google's Universal Sentence Encoder, a machine learning model that converts text into mathematical vectors (embeddings) that represent meaning. When you search, your query is converted to the same format and compared against stored embeddings to find semantically similar content.

### Can I backup my data?

Yes! Use the Export feature in Settings to download all your data as JSON or CSV files. The export includes all raw content and can be imported back into Snippet Vault or used with other tools.

### What happens if I delete the app?

Your data files remain in the user data directory and won't be deleted. If you reinstall Snippet Vault, it will find and use your existing data. To completely remove everything, you'd need to manually delete the database folder shown in Settings.

### Can I use this on multiple computers?

Each installation maintains its own local database. To sync data between computers, export from one machine and import to another. There's no automatic synchronization to maintain privacy and offline operation.

### What file formats can I import?

- **JSON**: Complete structured data with all fields
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet format with columns for id, type, description, payload, created_at, last_accessed_at

Required fields for import: `type`, `description`, `payload`

### How do I recover if something goes wrong?

Snippet Vault maintains dual storage:
1. **Raw Table**: Clean backup of your original content
2. **Embeddings Table**: AI-generated vectors for search

If embeddings become corrupted, they can be regenerated from the raw data without losing content. Always export your data before major operations like "Delete All Data".

### Can I add custom item types?

Currently, the UI supports "Links" and "Kusto Queries", but you can store any text content. The `type` field is flexible and you can use custom types when importing data programmatically.
